<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Carbon Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Fiber</li><li>Chopped Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aviation carbon fiber market is primarily divided into two types: continuous fiber and chopped fiber. Continuous fiber consists of long strands woven into composite materials, offering superior strength and durability for aircraft structures. This type is ideal for applications requiring high performance and structural integrity. Chopped fiber, on the other hand, consists of shorter strands and is often used in applications where lower weight and cost are more critical. This makes it suitable for components that require less strength and rigidity.</p></p>
