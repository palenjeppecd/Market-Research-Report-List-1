<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Supplied-air Respirators (SARs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Pressure Type</li><li>Negative-Pressure Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Supplied-air respirators (SARs) are critical respiratory protection devices that deliver clean air to the user from an external source. The market for SARs is categorized into two main types: positive-pressure type and negative-pressure type. Positive-pressure SARs maintain air pressure inside the facepiece, ensuring a continuous flow of air that keeps contaminants out, while negative-pressure SARs rely on the user’s inhalation to draw air through a filter, creating a less secure seal and requiring more careful use in hazardous environments.</p></p>
